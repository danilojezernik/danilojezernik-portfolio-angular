## Scrolling Functionality in Angular Component

This section explains the smooth scrolling functionality implemented in the Angular component. This functionality allows users to click on a question in a drawer, scroll to the corresponding question in the main content area, and automatically close the drawer after the scroll action.

### 1. Purpose

The scrolling functionality ensures that when a user clicks on a question in a drawer, the page smoothly scrolls to the corresponding question in the main content area. After scrolling, the drawer is closed automatically to enhance user experience.

### 2. Core Elements Involved

- **`@ViewChildren`**: Captures references to all question elements on the page, allowing the component to locate a specific question by its ID.
- **`@ViewChild`**: Captures a reference to the drawer's close button, enabling the component to programmatically close the drawer after scrolling.

### 3. Key Code Implementation

#### 3.1. Properties

```typescript
@ViewChildren('questionElement') questionElements!: QueryList<ElementRef>;
@ViewChild('closeButton') closeButton!: ElementRef<HTMLButtonElement>;
```
- `questionElements`: A `QueryList` of `ElementRef` objects that represents all the question elements on the page. The `#questionElement` template reference variable is used to mark each question in the HTML.
- `closeButton`: An `ElementRef` that references the drawer's close button, which is identified by the `#closeButton` template reference variable in the HTML.

#### 3.2. scrollToQuestion Method

```typescript
scrollToQuestion(questionId?: string) {
  const targetElement = this.questionElements.find((element) => element.nativeElement.id === questionId);
  if (targetElement) {
    // Scroll the target element into view with a smooth behavior
    targetElement.nativeElement.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
    
    // Close the drawer by programmatically clicking the close button
    this.closeButton.nativeElement.click();
  }
}
```
#### Functionality Overview:

1. **Parameter**: `questionId` (optional) - The unique identifier of the question element to scroll to. 
2. **Finding the Target Element**:
   - The method searches through the `questionElements` list to find the element whose id matches the provided `questionId`.
3. **Smooth Scrolling**:
   - Once the target element is found, the method calls `scrollIntoView` on that element, using the `{ behavior: 'smooth' }` option to enable smooth scrolling to the element.
4. Closing the Drawer:
   - After scrolling, the method programmatically triggers a click event on the `closeButton` element, which is the close button in the drawer. This ensures the drawer closes automatically after the scroll action.

#### 3.3. HTML Structure for Scrolling

Relevant parts of the HTML template:

```angular2html
<!-- Question element in the main content -->
<div #questionElement id="{{data._id}}">
  <!-- Question content here -->
</div>

<!-- Drawer with questions -->
<div id="drawer-right-example">
  <button #closeButton type="button" data-drawer-hide="drawer-right-example">Close</button>

  <div *ngFor="let data of angular">
    <a (click)="scrollToQuestion(data._id)"> {{ data.question }} </a>
  </div>
</div>
```
- `#questionElement`: Applied to each question in the content area to allow the `@ViewChildren` decorator to capture these elements.
- `#closeButton`: Applied to the drawer's close button to allow the `@ViewChild` decorator to reference this button for programmatically closing the drawer.

### 4. How It Works

1. **User Action**: The user clicks on a question link in the drawer. 
2. **Scroll Action**: The `scrollToQuestion` method is triggered, which locates the corresponding question in the content area and scrolls to it smoothly. 
3. **Drawer Closure**: After the scrolling is complete, the drawer is closed by simulating a click on the close button.
