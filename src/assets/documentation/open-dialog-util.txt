OPEN DIALOG UTIL
The openDialogUtil function is a utility designed to open a dialog to display data fetched by an ID. This function leverages Angular Material's MatDialog and is intended to streamline the process of displaying detailed data in a modal dialog.

Function Signature
The function accepts the following parameters:

_dialog: MatDialog instance used to open the dialog.
id: The ID used to fetch the data. This ID is critical as it determines which data is retrieved and displayed.
getDataById: A function that fetches data based on the provided ID. This function should initiate the process to retrieve the necessary data.
data$: An observable that emits the data fetched by the getDataById function. This observable should provide the data required for display in the dialog.
titleKey: A key used to extract the title from the data object. This title will be displayed at the top of the dialog.
error: A string indicating what interface the ID belongs to. This is used in the error message for better clarity.
Description
The openDialogUtil function handles the process of opening a dialog to display detailed information based on an ID. The function follows these steps:

ID Check: It first checks if an ID is provided. If no ID is given, it logs an error message indicating the requirement for a valid ID.
Data Fetching: If an ID is provided, it calls the getDataById function to fetch the necessary data.
Data Subscription: The function subscribes to the data$ observable to receive the data.
Dialog Opening: Upon receiving the data, the function opens a dialog using the MatDialog instance. The dialog component is populated with the data, and the title is set using the specified title key.
Error Handling: If no ID is provided, it logs a detailed error message specifying the need for a valid ID.
Example Usage
To use the openDialogUtil function within a component, you would set up the necessary parameters and invoke the utility function to open a dialog with the fetched data. Ensure that you have defined the method to fetch data by ID and the observable that emits this data.

Detailed Error Message
The error message is designed to provide clear and specific feedback if the required ID is not provided:
"Error: No ID provided. Please provide a valid [interface name] ID to display its details in the dialog."

This message indicates the type of ID that is missing, helping to quickly identify the issue.

Conclusion
The openDialogUtil function is a versatile and reusable utility for opening dialogs with data fetched by an ID. By encapsulating the logic within this utility function, it simplifies the process of displaying detailed information in a modal dialog, ensuring consistency and reducing repetitive code across the application.
